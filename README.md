# netlogo-fuzzy-logic-library
Collection of functions designed to facilitate the use of fuzzy logic within NetLogo

This folder contains:

+ fuzzy-logic.nls: the library itself, i.e. the netlogo code with all the functions.
+ documentation.pdf: a document explaining in detail how to use each of the functions implemented in the library.
+ cheat-sheet.pdf: a cheat sheet with all the functions implemented in the library.
+ tutorial.pdf: a tutorial created to illustrate how researchers can use the library to build agent-based models in which individual agents hold their own fuzzy concepts and use their own fuzzy rules, which may also change over time.
+ fuzzy-logic-library-model: the Netlogo model used in the tutorial.
